        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>You may be asking yourself, what is a churro? Well, churros are a Spanish or Mexican pastry, a bit like a donut or cruller, and are made from deep-fried unsweetened dough and then sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. Churros are normally formed into long lengths of dough pushed through a piping nozzle and then slowly added to a deep fryer or pan filled with hot oil until golden in color. Churros ingredients are pretty simple; they consist of water, butter, sugar, salt, flour, egg, and vanilla extract made into a dough and then deep-fried. Then, of course, sprinkled in sugar and normally served with a warm chocolate dipping sauce.</p>



        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>½ cup margarine</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a heavy deep skillet or deep-fryer, heat oil to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C). Oil should be about 1 1/2 inches deep.

            </li>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, heat water and margarine to a rolling boil. Combine the flour and salt; stir into the boiling mixture. Reduce heat to low and stir vigorously until the mixture forms a ball, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and beat in the eggs one at a time. Spoon the mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip.

            </li>
            <li>Carefully squeeze out 4 inch long strips of dough directly into the hot oil. Fry 3 or 4 strips at once, until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Remove from hot oil to drain on paper towels. Stir together the sugar and cinnamon; roll churros in the mixture while still hot.

            </li>

        </ol>
